Games:

[Witchball](https://lawraclark.itch.io/witchball/) by Lawra Suits Clark

Witchball is a post-reality racing game played by children in the year 2601. In Witchball, two players compete in a high speed foot-race while simultaneously playing a 2D pong-like ball game on the surface of the screen. Points are gained in both aspects and tallied per lap, so itâ€™s important -- and tricky -- to manage the space better than the opponent.
