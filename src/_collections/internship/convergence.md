Tempo Quest

By Pixel-boy

Everything was going as it’s supposed to be in Tempo-City when, coming from nowhere, an army of monster appeared. Nobody could explain what happened ! Not even the city’s wizard, who couldn’t do anything to stop the creatures. He needs time to study them, he needs samples from them. But he can’t do that all by himself ! So he called the best musicians et Dancing Stage champions (those famous japanese arcade games where you dance on arrowed platforms) to help him in this quest !
