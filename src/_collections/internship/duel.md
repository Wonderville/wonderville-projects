Nidhogg 2
By Messhof Games
Outsmart your opponents with all kinds of weapons in this life or death tug-of-war that ends in the belly of a flying worm. Stab, shoot, slice, or stomp your opponent to gain control of the screen, then book it to your side of the arena. Before long, a new opponent will appear in your way. If they kill you, they get control. Get all the way to your end of the arena to winâ€“and be devoured by the Nidhogg.

BADBLOOD
By Winnie Song
BADBLOOD is a deadly game of hide & seek. It is a local split-screen one-on-one brawler â€” a suspenseful game punctuated with frantic violence, where each player sees the arena from different orientations. As a vengeful character on a personal manhunt, you must use stealth, environment manipulation, and risk assessment to find and kill your opponent before they find you.
