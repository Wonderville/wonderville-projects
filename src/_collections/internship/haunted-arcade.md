[Haunted PS1 Demo Disc 2021](https://hauntedps1.itch.io/demodisc2021)

You awake to find yourself in a room swathed in shadow, the memories of your arrival much too painful to confront in your uncertain state. The room is empty - save for one thing. A stone pedestal, nakedly imposing. Something wants you to approach.

And you do.

On the pedestal lies a lone, cracked jewel case. Your fingers run across the surfaceâ€¦

Haunted PS1 Demo Disc 2020

Roused by the crackle of static, a lingering sense of dread crawls across the floor. You sit alone in your room. A dimly lit memory repeats in your head. 17 demos too horrible to describe keep you from your bed. Each one is a personally crafted nightmare. You've tried to tell others, no one understands. A CRT you don't remember owning flashes to life. Frozen in place you look upon the flickering screen to spy a dismal, bloodied scene. A cracked and faded jewel case sits close beside. A pale grey plastic box sits in front, emitting a low whirring noise. Will you take to the controller or let yourself be taken over?
