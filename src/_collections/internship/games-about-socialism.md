‘Socialism’ carries a plurality of meanings in today’s political sphere, and videogames reflect that plurality. To capture the various ways in which socialism is depicted, this gallery show presents a flight of six videogames, each of which offers a unique perspective. Some of these games serve as vehicles of history and culture; some prescribe strategy and action for today and tomorrow; others, renouncing seriousness all together, transform flags and manifestos into playgrounds of comedic possibilities. 

Games lineup:

Papers, Please

The communist state of Arstotzka has just ended a 6-year war with neighboring Kolechia and reclaimed its rightful half of the border town, Grestin. Your job as immigration inspector is to control the flow of people entering the Arstotzkan side of Grestin from Kolechia. Among the throngs of immigrants and visitors looking for work are hidden smugglers, spies, and terrorists. Using only the documents provided by travelers and the Ministry of Admission’s primitive inspect, search, and fingerprint systems, you must decide who can enter Arstotzka and who will be turned away or arrested.

Tonight We Riot Pixel Pushers Union 512 @PPU512

Tonight We Riot is a revolutionary crowd-based retro brawler featuring couch co-op. The game follows a player-controlled crowd of workers rather than a single character, each member with their own weapons, to fight against Pinkertons, militias, and police as they move their way through a level. Players can inspire more workers to join the crowd by liberating factories and encouraging more workers to join the fight.
