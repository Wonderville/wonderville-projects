Four experimental videogames to inspire love, terror and nostalgia. Hazy reinterpretations of a past-but-not-ancient era of Nintendo.

Terminal 64 by [Big](twitter.com/BIGBAGCO) [Bag Co](https://bigbag.itch.io) "Oh Peach... My sweet, sweet Peach... Mama Mia!" Mario has retired from plumbing. He begins his epic trek into the desert. Reflecting on his past, he stumbles upon Sparrot's Tavern and takes a dip. You don't want to know what happens next...

Winter 2001: Someone Tell Luigi I Love Him by [Joey](twitter.com/SchutzJoey) [Schutz](jamschutz.itch.io) Help Luigi find his brother.

Orchestra for Dying at Sea (Preview) by [Flan](twitter.com/big__flan) [Falacci](flan.itch.io) "Forgotten to any man, to any time, forgotten to any god or devil, forgotten even to the Sea, for any part of you, even any scantling of your soul is you no more, but is now itself the Sea"

With All My Heart by [jonny2lips](donnytulips.itch.io) Inspired by my memories as a lil kid playing the Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening on the Gameboy - specifically, Marin singing the Ballad of the Windfish in the village square.
