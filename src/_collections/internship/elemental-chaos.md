# ELEMENTAL CHAOS
**Curated by Alex Zheng**
**January 7, 2024**

This collection includes four games dealing brilliantly with the theme of ‘chaos’: real-time,
multi-task and randomization with their strategic driven mechanics.
Elemental Chaos is fascinating. It is a spirit living in a functional machine, while pure chaos is dull, in which everything alive will be wrapped up in some singleton. In the difference between these four games with and without the mechanics that cause chaos, there is something magical. In this vast labyrinth, you have less control than you imagine and more control than you realize.

Each decision in this game is made by pushing through several strategic layers, considering map construction and collection, current hand and the deck.

>I've been making games for a long time and I always make games I'd enjoy playing myself. I mainly make games for game jams and always run solo as I enjoy all the different sections of game development from coding to art and audio. The initial idea for this game actually came from the board game *Betrayal at House on the Hill*. But that was just the level building mechanic but I knew from the start that I wanted to make it a score based game. That's what I usually go for with jam games as they can be short but very replayable too. Then I just kept adding more and more skills to make the scoring more interesting and give runs some more variety. But then I actually had to start limiting the ideas as I was already hitting the size limit, the game was an entry to js13k jam, where everything needed to fit in a zip of 13 kilobytes. It was my first time participating in a jam with a hard restriction like this but I really enjoyed it! It was
fun trying to size optimize and try to squeeze every byte out that I could. After the jam I did expand on it a bit adding all the things I had to leave out and I will keep on working on it more in the future too.
