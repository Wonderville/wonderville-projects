*Play by Ear* is a showcase of games by independent creators themed around music. It featured karaoke and five games. While all the games were themed around music, each featured a unique style and gameplay. Players were encouraged to interact with sound and instruments through the featured games and focus on the different ways creators integrate music into their work.

## Koto
**Florian Decupper**
*Koto* is a cute and simple sound toy that emulates playing the koto, a Japanese string instrument. Of all the works on display, *Koto* gave players the most creative freedom, encouraging them to pluck through all the notes and slowly learn songs or create their own music. It is complete with beautifully illustrated visuals that make this otherwise simple software toy feel very special.

## Lo-Fi Room
**Bearmask**
*Lo-Fi Room* is a level-based rhythm game with search-and-click puzzle elements. The player searches around levels for different instruments to play, slowly building on the music made for each room. Unlike most other rhythm games, it is calm and not stressful to play, resulting in a very chill vibe that perfectly encapsulates the feel of lo-fi music. The game was set up in the cabana near the entrance, providing a perfect little private space to experience this relaxing game within a high-energy environment.

## A Dance of Fire and Ice

*A Dance of Fire and Ice* is a single button rhythm game where the player controls two orbiting planets as they travel down a winding path. The player must click to the beat of the music with very precise timing to progress along each level. Unlike the other rhythm game featured, this game was extremely difficult to play and required exact timing to progress. This difficulty made the game very addictive and a definite fan favorite of the show.

## Off-Peak
**CosmoD**
*Off-Peak* is a short first-person adventure game that takes place in one giant area with multiple nooks, crannies, and hidden passageways to discover. Players uncover a world where the fate of its musicians and artists is unclear, yet the tools of their trade are highly prized. This game features music on a much more conceptual level than the other games featured, questioning the value of artistry and instruments within this very atmospheric open world. The game was projected on the back wall of the stage, allowing all the show-goers to view the beautiful visuals while experiencing the original soundtrack.

## Midi the Cat
**Gaming Garrison**
*Midi the Cat* is a unique platformer made to use a MIDI keyboard as a controller. Play as Midi, a cat trapped in a strange sci-fi prison that is trapping cats for an unknown reason. Players control the cat with simple musical patterns that get progressively more complex as the game progresses. Designed to be playable by a total beginner to music, the game introduces basic musical concepts in an approachable way while keeping the player’s attention via the unique control scheme and intriguing story.
