Make a game in 2 hours!

Each month, we will make short games using simple to use game engines.

This is great for beginners who want to make AND FINISH their first game!

This is also great for experts who want to flex their skills and meet new people.

The first month, we will be making Hypertext Games in Neocities based on a random suggestion we will get from Wikipedia.

Hypertext Games are games that are based on clicking links in a web browser.

Neocities is a service that allows users to easily make websites (I don't recommended it but you can even make them on your phone).
