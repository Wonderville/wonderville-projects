Welcome and hello doomers

In this edition of 2HR GAMEJAM OF THE MONTH CLUB participants will learn the fundamentals of modern doom mapping with Ultimate Doom Builder (UDB), SLADE3, and DSDA-DOOM (all resources will be provided)

Windows 10/11 strongly recommended unless you’re good at porting PC apps, we will be targeting the DSDA-DOOM sourceport with the MBF21 complevel (so no ZDOOM ACS/UDMF!)

Doomers will have 2 hours to make their maps, with expert consultation provided by community veteran wallh4x — the sky’s the limit (-removing source port)
