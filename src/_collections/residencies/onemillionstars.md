A chaotic ballet of color, a face-melting symphony of laser light action, an epic quest to infinity with 4 characters, unlockable ships, and local co-op. Old school arcade gameplay meets roguelike replayability in a psychedelic fever dream. Hold onto your butts, itâ€™s a long way to ONE MILLION STARS.
