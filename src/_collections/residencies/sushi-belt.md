Make sushi and feed customers using the innovative technology of conveyor belts!

Controls:
-Arrow keys to move around the kitchen.
-Bump into counter space to pickup ingredients (red=fish, white=rice, green=seaweed).
-Find out recipes from the book in the lower right.
-Discard used plates and botched recipes in the lower left sink.
-üÖæÔ∏è (Z or C) to drop an item on the floor.
-You can carry up to 3 items!

Sushi Crafting:
-Dishes are made by combining three ingredients on the makisu (sushi mat).
-Order does not matter!
-If you don't know the recipe, it will become poop which should be discarded.
-The game is played over a week, each day you learn a new recipe.
