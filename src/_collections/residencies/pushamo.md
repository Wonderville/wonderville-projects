PUSH BLOCKS. FORM SQUARES. OR DIE TRYING!
Pushamo is an arcade push-em-up. You control a character, pushing shapes within a grid to form squares, which clears blocks and earns points. Bigger and more spectacular clears grant you even more points!
Your goal is to reach 4000 points as fast as you can.
