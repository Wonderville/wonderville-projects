A re-imagining of the arcade classic PAC-MAN. Made in PICO-8.

LEMON-SHARK is a turn-based puzzle game where you must complete the maze by eating all the pellets while avoiding the squids (octopi? i am not sure.)
Each squid behaves differently, and they only move when you do.
Pay close attention to not get caught by them!
