An ancient evil threatens the island nation of Japan. The League of Ninjas has pin-pointed the orgin. A small set of Southern islands, but how do you seal a great evil from crawling out beneath the earth? YOU NAIL THE EARTH DOWN!!!

Smash all of the stakes down through four rounds to seal the evil away, and achieve victory over said evil. BUT, be careful. Demons will try to prevent you from getting to this most holy goal.
