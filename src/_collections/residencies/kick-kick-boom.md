Kick Kick Boom is a 1v1 fight for survival in a tiny room full of falling bombs. Its super simple 2-button controls can be picked up by anyone in just a few seconds, but players will find plenty of depth to the game. It’s super constrained design is inspired by other [Arcade Commons](https://arcadecommons.org/) classics like “Nothing Good Can Come of This” and “Super Sharp Birds,” so if you’re a fan of those, be sure to check it out!
