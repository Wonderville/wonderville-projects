Wire Tripper is an original puzzle game that challenges the player to bridge connections across the play field and bust blocks, all while new rows constantly spring up from below. The speed and challenge ramp up as your level increases, though your perseverance is rewarded with new buddies who are unlocked as players hit new high score milestones. These fun little guys will pop out and cheer you one if you can maintain your CEASELESS COMBO (and also decorate the title screen). New players are treated to a full tutorial and, for a more relaxed time, ver 1.1 features a "Chill Mode" where you can learn the ropes or just chill out.
