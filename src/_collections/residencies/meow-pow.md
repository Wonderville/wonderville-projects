[Meow Pow](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1348680/Meow_Pow/) is an energetic, high-speed sports-ish game. With easy-to-understand controls and fluid, physics-driven movement, players dart around the arena as cats, slapping everything in sight. 1 - 4 players local matches, players can go up against the AI, friends, or both.
