Jump and Puzzle is an asymmetrical cooperative puzzle platformer for two friends where one player builds the level to help the other player escape. The player building the level gets blocks Tetris-style and they help their friend by building ways for them to reach a key and finish the level. Blocks can contain bombs, enemies, ice blocks that freeze the map, amoeba blocks that slowly grow, flower blocks that shoot seeds and grow more blocks, bounce pads, spikes, and plenty more! Each level is a puzzle that starts off pre-built and has specific blocks that can spawn. Some require you to destroy structures, or plant a garden, or evade rising lava to help the platforming player reach the exit!
