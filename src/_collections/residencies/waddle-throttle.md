Waddle Throttle is a fast-paced mashup of figure skating, sumo wrestling, and bumper cars. In this game, you take on the role of penguins battling for dominance over each level's floating ice sheets. Compete against your rivals by bumping them off, utilizing power-ups, and gobbling up fish to grow bigger. There are three ways to win: survive to the end of the round with the most health, eliminate all other players, or eat ten fish and stay on your ice sheet without being knocked off.
