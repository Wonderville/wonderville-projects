Zan Emerson (they/them) is a marketing director, manager, and creative consultant for today’s pre-eminent adventurous art. Primarily, they have worked behind the scenes in almost every role in almost every setting in NYC live music save Madison Square Garden – from 100-piece orchestras in rented cathedrals, to DIY punk shows, to legendary underplays on Bleecker Street.

A deep believer in both workers’ rights and the life-altering power of live music, Zan strives to harness their passion for this line of work, not only to connect art with audiences, but to uplift the entire industry on stage and behind the scenes.
