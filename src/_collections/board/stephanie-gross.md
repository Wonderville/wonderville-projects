Stephanie is the co-founder of Wonderville. She has over 10 years of experience working with local arts organizations, helping them to navigate the bureaucracy of the city and file paperwork to become non-profits. Sheâ€™s also worked with the Department of Consumer Affairs and is currently a senior director at the Department of Finance.

Stephanie and her husband Mark met at the underground music venue Death By Audio back in 2010. They wanted to take their experience from the DIY scene and create a new type of venue - one that exists legally, with all of the proper licensing and permits, but also strives to showcase independent games, music, and art.
